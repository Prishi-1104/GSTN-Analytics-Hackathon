Predictive Model in GST | Python, Machine Learning, Evaluation Metrics

 Built a Random Forest-based predictive model to analyze and classify GST-related data. The model processes structured data, evaluates performance using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, and visualizes results with
 confusion matrices and ROC curves.This model can help in tax compliance analysis, fraud detection, or predicting tax liabilities.
